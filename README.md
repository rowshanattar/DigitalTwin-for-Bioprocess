# EKF-Based Digital Twin for Bioreactor State Estimation 

A Python implementation of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) Digital Twin
for baker's yeast batch cultivation, developed as part of a Master's thesis
on predictive maintenance and root cause analysis in bioprocesses.

## Overview

This repository implements and extends the method described in:

> Yousefi-Darani, A., Paquet-Durand, O., & Hitzmann, B. (2020).
> *The Kalman Filter for the Supervision of Cultivation Processes.*
> In: Herwig, C., Pörtner, R., Möller, J. (eds) **Digital Twins.**
> Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology, vol 177.
> Springer, Cham.
> https://doi.org/10.1007/10_2020_145

The Digital Twin combines a nonlinear biological process model (Monod
kinetics) with a Continuous-Discrete Extended Kalman Filter to
continuously estimate unmeasured state variables — biomass, glucose,
and maximum specific growth rates — from sparse ethanol measurements
arriving every 5 minutes.

## The Digital Twin

The EKF estimates 5 state variables simultaneously:

| Variable | Description | Unit | Measured? |
|---|---|---|---|
| X | Biomass concentration | g/L | No — estimated |
| G | Glucose concentration | g/L | No — estimated |
| E | Ethanol concentration | g/L | Yes — every 5 min |
| μmax,G | Max. growth rate on glucose | h⁻¹ | No — estimated |
| μmax,E | Max. growth rate on ethanol | h⁻¹ | No — estimated |

The process model is based on Monod kinetics (Equation 19,
Yousefi-Darani et al., 2020). The Jacobian matrix required for
covariance propagation is computed analytically using symbolic
differentiation via `sympy`.

## Research hypotheses

This project investigates four hypotheses beyond the baseline:

**H1 — Observability limit:**
How many unmeasured state variables can be added before the EKF
loses the ability to reliably estimate them from a single measurement?

**H2 — Additional measurements:**
How does estimation accuracy improve when additional sensors
(pH, dissolved CO₂, temperature) are incorporated?

**H3 — Fault identification:**
Can EKF residuals not only detect faults but also identify their
root cause through structured residual analysis?

**H4 — Sensor degradation robustness:**
How robust is the EKF against increasing measurement noise (H4a)
and systematic sensor drift over time (H4b)?

## Why Python instead of MATLAB?

The original paper provides MATLAB code in the appendix. This
implementation uses Python because:

- Free and open source — no license required
- `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` is equivalent to MATLAB's `ode45`
  (both implement the Dormand-Prince RK45 algorithm)
- `sympy` provides symbolic differentiation equivalent to MATLAB's
  Symbolic Math Toolbox
- Fully reproducible and shareable without software dependencies
